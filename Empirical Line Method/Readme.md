# Overview

The codes here are the used for applying empirical line method and radiometric calibration to low-cost camera. Also is the code `undistort.py` that apply the equations for fixing the distortions radial, tangential of the camera through of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera got through the toolbox of geometric calibration Matlab of Caltech.

# Instructions

The execution of the files is in this order otherwise the codes will not have the necessary supplies for working.

1. `code_1.m`
2. `medianas.m`
3. `relation_V2.m`
4. Here there are three options manually: `extract.py`, automatic: `extract-otsu.py` `extract-Rosin.py`
5. `correct-equation.m`
